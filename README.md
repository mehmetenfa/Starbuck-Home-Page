 - ğŸ‘‰  I used HTML-CSS languages while making Starbuck homepage. ğŸ‘Œ
 - ğŸ‘‰ The website continues towards the bottom and I made a fully responsive site. ğŸ‘Œ
 - ğŸ‘‰ I did not use any photos on the site, I took and placed all of them myself and I copied and put the logo from their original site. ğŸ‘Œ
